  <p>The Challenge<br /><span>Branding self expression.</span></p>
  <p><a href="https://www.rawpoets.com">The Raw Poets</a> are a poetry collective based in New York City. The acronym stands for Rebellious Assertive Writers, which best describes the group’s dynamic. I set out to design an identity that represents the group’s unique take on spoken word.
  <br /><br />
  Being a group of writers first, the pen serves as an icon for these wordsmiths.</p>

  <p>What's in a brand?<br /><span>The RAW Poets ethos</span></p>
  <p>The brand focuses on juxstaposing clean minimalism &amp; grit. With every promotional image, we aim to delight visually, but keep typography clean and prominent. Designing for a poetry group– we've got to respect words.</p>
